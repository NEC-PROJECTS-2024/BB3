### INTRODUCTION
The Phishing is a sort of social designing assault regularly used to take client
information, including login accreditations and credit card numbers. With
the enhancements in internet technology, websites are the major resource
for the cyber-attacks. There are several counter measures available for
avoiding phishing attacks, but phishers are changing their attacking
methods from time to time. One of the most widely used techniques for
solving cybersecurity issues is machine learning. From last several years,
Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques are suitable for solving
security related issues. Machine Learning is most suitable for detecting
phishing attacks because most of the phishing attacks have common
characteristics. This paper has applied several machine learning techniques
for detecting the phishing attacks. Here, two prioritybased algorithms are
proposed. Based on the results of these algorithms, the final fusion classifier
is decided. We used a dataset from UCI and applied a novel fusion classifier
and achieved an accuracy of 97%. We used Python for implementing our
experiments.
